This repository contains the final research project for **UT Austin's CS 395T: Case Studies in Machine Learning**, exploring three critical healthcare applications:  

1. **COVID-19 Vaccine Design**: Ensemble ML models to predict immunogenic epitopes.  
2. **Pneumonia Detection**: CheXNet CNN outperforming radiologists (F1=0.435).  
3. **Breast Cancer Prediction**: 92.55% accuracy with hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest.   

Key technical skills: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, GridSearchCV, statistical validation.
